Every CTCFT Meeting has its own page, found on the left. The page contains the agenda and, after the meeting takes place, it is updated with notes and links to a recording (if any). Meeting agenda items are always announced at least one week in advance of the next meeting (often more).

## Meeting slides

You can find the slides for the various presentations on our [hackmd team page](https://hackmd.io/@rust-ctcft).

## Meeting recordings

Meetings will be recorded and those recordings will be posted publicly. We may even attempt to stream them. Recording the meetings serves several purposes:

* It makes the meetings accessible to folks who cannot attend in person or who must miss a week.
* The recordings of the meetings become another channel for people to follow along with what is happening in Rust.

## Rules for participation

* The meeting is open for anyone to observe ([read more](./faq.html#who-can-attend-the-meeting)).
* We will use a **meeting queue** to ensure everyone who wants to speak has a chance. The queue is managed by the MC.
    * To add yourself to the queue, write `o/` in the chat.
    * To remove yourself from the queue, write `nm` in the chat.
    * If you you prefer, you can also ask a question for the speaker in the chat and the MC can read it out loud.
* Please keep your **video off** unless you are expecting to speak.
    * If you are enqueued or expect you may well enqueue yourself soon, then feel free to turn it on.
    * This way the set of folks visible reflects who is actively participating at that moment.
* Stay **muted** when not speaking.
* Please **avoid extensive conversations in the chat** -- quick Q&A is ok.

## Timing of the meeting

The meetings are targeted for the third Monday of every month. The timing of the meeting varies month-to-month in an attempt to capture more time zones (and to accommodate the speakers). See the [CTCFT Calendar] for details.
