# ⚙️ Meta: For the organizers

This page documents the procedures that we use as CTCFT organizers. It's mostly for our own reference!

## Week before CTCFT

* Check in with speakers
* Encourage people to put their slides in the hackmd page
* Create the agenda slide deck

## Day of CTCFT

* Tweet from CTCFT account

## Orientation emeting

The week after each CTCFT, we hold an **orientation meeting** with the following agenda:

* Brief retro: How did that CTCFT go?
* For next month:
    * If not enough talks have been submitted to make an agenda, brainstorm people to ping.
* For über-next month:
    * Select theme and time
    * Create a page for it on the CTCFT repository
    * Create calendar event
    * Create github label

*Definition:* The über-next month of March is May.

## After each CTCFT

* Post video to YouTube playlist, update page with link
* Get slides from people, if none were submitted, and link to them
* Tweet about it
